1. Fourier transform of a Gaussian is also Gaussian: So we have Gaussians in both time and frequency domains which are mathematically easy to analyse
2. You can differentiate the Gaussian function infinite number of times
3. In statistics, the importance of Gaussian distribution comes from the central limit theorem. This in essence says, if you sum up lot of independent distributions, the eventual distribution is a Gaussian. i.e,  if  𝑋1,𝑋2,…,𝑋𝑛 are independent random variables, the sum of these variables 𝑋=𝑋1+𝑋2+⋯+𝑋𝑛will have a  Gaussian distribution.This  property can be used to generate  random numbers having a Gaussian  distribution using random numbers generated from uniform distribution.
